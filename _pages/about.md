Hi! I am Hyeongjun Jeon, currently working as a software engineer. I received bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering in 2021 in Sungkyunkwan University. After that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering under the supervision of [Dr.Beomseok Nam](http://dicl.skku.edu/~bnam/). in 2023. My research topics were distributed systems, file systems, and developing middleware(Key-Value Store) platform. I am now highly interested in computer systems, computer architecture, linux kernel, middleware, high performance computing and so many. For more details, please refer to my [CV](http://dicl.skku.edu/~hjeon/hjeon-cv.pdf).
